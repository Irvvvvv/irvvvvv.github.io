        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Irving Garcia-Gomez</strong>, and I'm from Lumberton, North Carolina. I am currently a sophomore at the <strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</strong>, majoring in <strong>Information Science</strong>
            with a minor in <strong>Data Science</strong>. My interests include user experience, interface design, and inclusive technology that makes digital tools more accessible to everyone. </p>
            
            <p>My passion for technology began
            when I was six years old, watching my older brothers play on the PlayStation 2. I remember being captivated by the bright, colorful graphics and display of certain video games. I also
            remember how simple yet efficient the user interface was for the console, which led to several fun and memorable experiences.</p> 
            
            <p>Since then, I've pursued opportunities that allow me to combine creativity,
            leadership, and community. I currently serve as the <strong>Outreach Coordinator</strong> for <strong>Latinos In Tech (SHPE)</strong>, where I connect students with professional opportunities and foster an inclusive tech community. 
            I am also <strong>a SILS Student Ambassador</strong>, representing the School of Information and Library Science, and a <strong>Kessler Intern</strong>, where I collaborate on initiatives supporting first-generation college students.</p>

            <p>Beyond my academic and leadership experiences, I have developed strong technical and design skills. I am proficient in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong> for web development, and experienced
            in design tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>. These tools allow me to combine creativity with technical ability to create accessible digital experiences that empower communities.</p>
